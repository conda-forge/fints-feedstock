  summary: FinTS client library for Python
  description: |
    Many operations in FinTS will require a form of two-step
    authentication, called TANs. TANs are mostly required for operations
    that move money or change details of a bank account. TANs can be
    generated with a multitude of methods, including paper lists, 
    smartcard readers, SMS messages, and smartphone apps.
